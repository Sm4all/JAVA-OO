Ideas for Dungeon Escape + Maze map

-4 by 4 grid
-different things happening in each room
    -Random chance of being led to the monster room and then redirected back
    -Will have a health bar
    -Some rooms will have traps and will make you lose health
    -You have a monster chasing you and if you make a wrong move it will catch you up
        -Say something like in this room you tripped and fell...The monster moved closer
    -Rooms where you need to gather fragments of a code in the background image?
    -You find a room at the end of the maze that requires a key to unlock the final door
    -You must find the key to unlock the door somewhere else in the maze
    -The key is protected by a code in which you must type in links to the code that is in line 10 of this.
        -This forces the user to explore around the maze.
        -Code randomly generates?
            -Each fragment as different objects.
-NPC encounter giving you advice and where to go after so many moves have been made
